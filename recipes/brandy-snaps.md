# Brandy Snaps

## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Butter | 55g |
| Demarara sugar | 55g |
| Golden syrup (light treacle) | 55g |
| Ground ginger | $\frac{1}{2}$ tsp |
| Lemon juice | $\frac{1}{2}$ tsp |
| Plainflour | 50g |


## Yield

16 brandy snaps


## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/Gas

2. Line two baking trays with baking   parchment then oil a thickish handle of
   a wooden spoon and lay it on a cooling rack. 

3. Measure the butter, sugar and syrup into a small, heavy-based pan. The
   easiest way is to measure the butter, then the sugar on the scales (in the
   pan if you have digital scales), then measure the syrup on top to make up to
   165g/6oz total weight. 

4. Heat gently until the butter has melted and the sugar has dissolved. This
   will take about 15 minutes over a low heat. Don't let the mixture boil as it
   may crystallise. To check when the sugar has dissolved, stir occasionally,
   pulling the spoon across the bottom of the pan until you can no longer hear
   the gritty granules being scraped along and most of them have disappeared. 

5. Leave the mixture to cool slightly, about 2-3 minutes, then sieve in the
   flour and ginger. Pour in the lemon juice and stir well to mix thoroughly.
   Drop four teaspoonfuls of the mixture onto each of the prepared baking trays
   to make neat circles, about 10cm/4in apart. 

6. Bake in the pre-heated oven for about 10-15 minutes, or until the mixture is
   well spread out, looks lacy and is a dark golden colour. 

7. Once baked, you need to work fast to shape the brandy snaps, so its easier
   if you bake one tray at a time. Remove each tray from the oven and leave for
   a minute or so to firm up slightly, then lift from the baking parchment
   using a fish slice. The mixture needs to be just firm enough to remove, but
   pliable enough to shape. Check by releasing around and under the edges with
   a small palette knife. 

8. Quickly roll a circle of the warm mixture around the handle of the wooden
   spoon, having the join underneath. Press the join lightly together to seal,
   then slide the brandy snap off the spoon and leave it to firm up on the wire
   rack, again with the join underneath. If any of the circles on the sheet
   harden too much to work with, put them back in the oven for a few seconds to
   soften again. Repeat until all the mixture has been used.

9. If the mixture in the pan becomes too firm to drop in neat spoonfuls, roll a
   teaspoonful of it into a small smooth ball in your hands, sit it on the
   baking tray and flatten slightly with your fingers. When cold, store the
   brandy snaps in an airtight tin or container; they will keep for at least a
   week.
