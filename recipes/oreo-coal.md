# Oreo Coal

## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Oreos | 40 Oreos |
| Cream cheese, softened | 1 block (8 oz) |
| Semisweet chocolate | 16 oz |

## Yield

38—40 pieces of coal

## Directions

1. In a food processor, grind the Oreos into crumbs. Transfer the crumbs to a
   medium bowl and add cream cheese. Use a fork to mix until well-combined.

2. Form the mixture into lumps of coal, about 1 Tbsp each. Place them on a
   plate and into the fridge for about 30 minutes to 1 hour to firm up.

3. Microwave the chocolate in 10—15-second increments until melted and smooth.
   Using a fork or toothpick, dip each Oreo ball into the melted chocolate,
   then set onto parchment paper.
