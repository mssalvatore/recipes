# Sourdough Discard Crumpets

## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Sourdough discard (unfed) | 1 cup |
| Sugar | 1 tsp |
| Salt | $\frac{1}{2}$ tsp |
| Baking soda | scant $\frac{1}{2}$ tsp |

## Directions

1. Place the starter in a medium-sized bowl. Stir in the sugar and salt, 
   then the baking soda. The batter should rise up and bubble a bit, 
   becoming almost billowy.

2. Melt oil on a griddle or frying pan. When hot, drop batter on as you would
   when making small pancakes. Cook for about 5 minutes, until the tops are set 
   and full of small holes. Carefully flip the crumpets over and continue to 
   cook for about 3 minutes, until they're golden on the bottom. 

3. Serve hot, with butter or jam.
