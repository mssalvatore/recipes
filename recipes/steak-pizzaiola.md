## Directions

1. Thinly slice the garlic for the meat. Cut small slits in the steak between

2. Sprinkle the salt, pepper, oregano, and Pecorino romano on the steak. Hold
   some of the seasoning back for step 4.

3. Make a garlic paste and spread it on top of the steak (optional).

4. Use a food processor to blend the tomatoes to the desired texture. Don't
   overdo it! Pour the tomatoes over the steak and spread them out evenly. Add
   the remaining seasoning to on top.

5. Cover with foil and bake at 250 for about 1 $\frac{3}{4}$ hours, or until the steak
   reaches an internal temperature of 130째F.

6. Remove the foil and set aside. Bake for $\frac{1}{2}$ hour at 350째F or until the steak reaches an internal
   temperature of 135째F - 145째F.

7. Remove the steak from the oven, cover with foil, and let rest for 10-15 minutes.

8. Slice across the grain and serve.


## Notes
- It's best to prepare the steak the night before you plan to cook it.
- The chuck steak will be whatever size it is. The measurements for this recipe
  are, therefore, guidelines.
