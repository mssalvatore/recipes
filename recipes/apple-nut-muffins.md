## Directions

1. In a saucepan, melt butter. Stir in brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, and nutmeg until smooth.

3. In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each. Beat in vanilla.

4. Combine dry ingredients; add to creamed mixutre alternatively with sour cream. 

5. Spoon $\frac{1}{4}$ cupfuls of batter into greased muffins cups. Spoon apple mixture into the center of each (do not spread). Top with remaining batter. Sprinkle with cinnamon-sugar.

6. Bake at 350°F for 25—27 minutes or until muffins test done. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks.


## Notes
- If using regular-sized muffin cups, fill cups half full with batter; add a rounded teaspoonful of apple mixture and remaining batter. Bake for 16—18 minutes.
