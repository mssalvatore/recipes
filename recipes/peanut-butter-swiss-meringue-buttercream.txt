2 1/4 cups granulated sugar 495g
7 large egg whites 218g
3 3/4 sticks unsalted butter, softened 425g
1/2 cup creamy peanut butter
1 1/2 tablespoons clear vanilla

1) Start by placing the egg whites and sugar in a large metal bowl. I used the bowl that came with my Kitchenaid mixer. Whisk the egg whites and sugar together.


2) Place over a pot of boiling water while beating the mixture like crazy. Do NOT stop beating. You donâ€™t want scrambled eggs. Continue beating until the sugar dissolves. About 2 minutes or until 160 degrees to pasteurize the eggwhites.

3) Remove from heat and beat with an electric mixer on medium high (using a whisk attachment) for 20 minutes.

4) Turn mixer down to low and gradually add butter. Turn mixer up to medium and beat for a few minutes. Turn mixer down and add vanilla. Mix again. Now add the peanut butter. Beat on medium for a few minutes.

5) If the mixture is soupy, place in refrigerator for a couple of hours. Then take out and beat again on medium high for a few mintues.
