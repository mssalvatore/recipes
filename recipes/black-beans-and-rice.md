# Black Beans and Rice

## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Black beans | 11 cans (15.5 oz each) |
| Garlic | 11 cloves (about 60g) |
| Ground beef | 3 lbs |
| Olive oil | As needed |
| Onion | 1 large onion |
| Oregano | 8g |
| Pepper | 6g |
| Salt | 9g |
| Sour cream | For serving |


## Directions

1. Use a garlic press to press the garlic into a small container. Set aside.

2. Chop the onion and set aside.

3. Open the beans. Drain 7 of the cans and leave 4 cans undrained. Set aside.

4. Heat enough olive oil to fry the onions in a large pot over medium heat. Add
   the onions and sprinkle some of the salt. Cook the onions until they become
   tender and translucent.

5. Add the ground beef to the pot. Sprinkle some of the salt and pepper and
   cook until browned.

6. (Optional) Drain the excess fat from the beef. If this step is skipped, cook
   the garlic (step 7) in a separate skillet.

7. Push the beef to the sides of the pot to create a well in the center. Pour
   in enough olive oil to fry the garlic. Heat the oil and add the garlic to
   the hot oil. Sprinkle some salt and keep the garlic moving with a spatula.
   Just as the garlic begins to brown, quickly mix it in with the ground beef
  to prevent the garlic from burning.

8. Add the black beans to the pot. Stir in the oregano and remaining salt and
   pepper.

9. Simmer on low heat until any excess liquid has evaporated (1-2 hours). Stir
   occasionally.

10. Cover and cook until the flavors blend (1-2 hours). Serve over rice with
    sour cream.
