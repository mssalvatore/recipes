# Garlic Rice

## Ingredients


| Ingredient | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Butter (optional) | 60g |
| Garlic | 7 cloves |
| Olive oil | As needed |
| Rice | 450g |
| Salt | 5g |
| Water | 950g |


## Directions

1. Use a garlic press to press the garlic into a small
   container. Set aside.

2. Measure out the rice and pour it into a fine-mesh strainer. Rinse the rice
   until the water runs clear. Set aside.

3. In a medium pot heat enough olive oil to cover the bottom of the pot. Pour
   the pressed garlic in and stir with a spatula. Sprinkle some salt and keep
   the garlic moving with the spatula.

4. Just as the garlic begins to brown, quickly mix in the rice to prevent the
   garlic from burning.

5. Measure out the water and add it to the pot with the rice and garlic. Stir
   the ingredients together and simmer until all of the water is absorbed
   (15-20 minutes).

6. Mix in the salt and butter (optional) and fluff the rice with a fork. Adjust
   seasoning to taste.
