# Garlic Rice

## Ingredients


| Ingredient | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Butter (optional) | 60g |
| Garlic | 28g (about 7 cloves) |
| Olive oil | As needed |
| Rice | 450g |
| Salt | 5g |
| Water | 950g |


## Directions

1. Use a garlic press to press the garlic into a small
   container. Set aside.

2. Measure out the rice and pour it into a fine-mesh strainer. Rinse the rice
   until the water runs clear. Set aside.

3. Measure out the water. Set aside

4. In a medium pot heat enough olive oil to cover the bottom of the pot. Pour
   the pressed garlic in and stir with a spatula. Sprinkle some salt and keep
   the garlic moving with the spatula.

5. Just as the garlic begins to brown, quickly mix in the rice to prevent the
   garlic from burning.

6. Add the water and stir the ingredients together.

7. Simmer uncovered until all of the water is absorbed (15-20 minutes).

8. Mix in the salt (and optional butter) and fluff the rice with a fork. Adjust
   the seasoning to taste.
