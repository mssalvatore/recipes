# Lemon Curd

## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Granulated sugar | 1 cup |
| Lemon zest | 2 Tbsp (~ 2 lemons) |
| Egg yolks | 6 eggs |
| Lemon juice | ~ $\frac{1}{2}$ cup |
| Unsalted butter, cold | $\frac{1}{2}$ cup |

## Directions

1. Zest the lemons, then juice the lemons until you have about
   $\frac{1}{2}$ cup of lemon juice; make sure to strain out the seeds.

2. Place the egg yolks in a pot and beat lightly with a whisk, adding
   the sugar and mixing thoroughly. Stir in the lemon zest and juice gradually.

3. Heat on low, stirring constantly with a whisk until the mixture
   thickens, just starts to boil, and coats the back of a wooden spoon.

4. Remove the pot from the heat, then add the cold, cubed butter and
   mix until melted.

5. Transfer the curd to a glass jar to cool. When cooled, seal and place it
   in the fridge to continue to set.
