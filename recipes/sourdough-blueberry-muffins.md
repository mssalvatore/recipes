1. Crumb topping: Place the melted butter, flour and sugar in a bowl and use a 
   fork to mix until it becomes a coarse crumble. Set aside.

2. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line muffin tins or grease generously to prevent sticking.

3. Dry ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking soda, baking 
   powder, cornstarch, lemon zest, and salt.. Add the blueberries and toss the mixture to 
   coat.Set aside.

4. Wet ingredients: In a medium mixing bowl, whisk all the wet ingredients until smooth. Pour
   the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. (If the batter 
   is too stiff, add 1–2 tablespoons of water or milk to help thin it down.)

5. Divide the batter evenly and sprinkle the top with the crumble topping. Make sure to press the 
   crumble, gently, onto the top of the batter.

6. Bake for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.
   Let muffins cool in the tin for 10 minutes before removing to cool on a cooling rack.
