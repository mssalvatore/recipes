# Apple Pie

## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Granulated sugar | $\frac{1}{2}$ cup (or less) |
| Brown sugar, packed | $\frac{1}{2}$ cup (or less) |
| All-purpose flour | $\frac{1}{4}$ cup |
| Cinnamon | 1 tsp |
| Nutmeg | $\frac{1}{2}$ tsp |
| Salt | $\frac{1}{8}$ tsp |
| Granny Smith apples | 7—8 apples |
| Lemon juice | 1 Tbsp |
| All-butter pie crust | top and bottom crusts |
| Egg wash | 1 large egg, beaten |

## Directions

1. Combine sugars, flour, spices, and salt in a small bowl; mix. 

2. Slice apples into small-ish slices or chunks and then coat with lemon juice;
   mix and let stand for a few minutes.

3. Add the flour mixture to apples; mix thoroughly. 

4. Egg wash the crust, then fill the pie. Cover with crust (lattice
   preferred!), then egg wash that as well. Bake at 400°F for at least 30
   minutes, then lower the temp to 350°F for probably another 30 minutes, or
   until crust is golden. 

## Notes
-  It's best to use a glass pie plate to ensure that the bottom of the crust is
   thoroughly baked — no soggy bottoms!

-  When turning the temperature down, use a foil ring to cover the edge of the
   crust or simply drape a piece of foil across the entire top of the pie. This
   will keep the top of the crust from burning as the bottom continues to bake.
