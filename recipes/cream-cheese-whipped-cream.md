# Cream Cheese Whipped Cream

## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Cream cheese | 226g (8oz) |
| Heavy whipping cream | 1 $\frac{3}{4}$ cups |
| Powdered sugar | 130g |
| Vanilla extract | 2 tsp |


## Directions


1. Place your mixing bowl in the freezer or fridge 5-10 minutes before
   starting.

2. Beat cold cream cheese on medium-high speed for until cream cheese is smooth
   and free of lumps (2-3 minutes). Scrape down the sides of the bowl
   occasionally.

3. Slowly drizzle in the heavy whipping cream and continue beating until the
   cream cheese resembles a liquid mixture.

4. Continue to add the remaining heavy whipping cream and beat on medium-high
   speed until soft peaks form.

5. Add the powdered sugar and vanilla extract and beat until stiff peaks form.


## Notes
- This is great as a cake icing or a condiment with breakfast (such as
  pancakes, waffles, or baked oatmeal). It can also be used as a filling for
  pastries like [brandy snaps](brandy-snaps.md) and [cream
  puffs](cream-puffs.md).
