# Meatballs

## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Eggs | 6 eggs |
| Garlic | 30g |
| Ground beef | 2 lbs |
| Ground pork | 1 lb |
| Italian-style bread crumbs | 375g |
| Milk | 170g |
| Olive oil | for frying |
| Parsley (dried) | 6g |
| Pecorino romano (grated) | 75g |
| Pepper | 2g |
| Salt | 8g |


## Directions

1. Beat the eggs until they are well mixed.

1. Finely chop the garlic.

1. Put all of the ingredients together in a large bowl. Using your hands, mix
   thoroughly until all of the ingredients are evenly mixed.

1. Fry the meatballs in olive oil until a golden-brown crust forms on each
   side, or the center is cooked as desired.

## Notes

- This recipe is tested with Progresso-brand bread crumbs.
- The original recipe calls for 3 cups (about 450g) of bread crumbs. I found
  this to be too bready.
- Don't bake the meatballs... Just... Don't. Fry them.
