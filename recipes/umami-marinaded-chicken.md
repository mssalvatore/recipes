# Umami-Marinaded Chicken

## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Extra virgin olive oil | $\frac{1}{2}$ cup |
| Balsamic or red wine vinegar | $\frac{1}{2}$ cup |
| Soy sauce | $\frac{1}{4}$ cup |
| Worcestershire sauce | $\frac{1}{4}$ cup |
| Lemon juice | $\frac{1}{8}$ cup |
| Brown sugar | $\frac{3}{4}$ cup |
| Rosemary | 2 tsp |
| Salt | 1 $\frac{1}{2}$ tsp |
| Brown mustard | 2 Tbsp |
| Pepper | 1 tsp |
| Garlic powder | 2 tsp |
| Boneless chicken breasts | 6 pieces (~ 3.5 lbs) |

## Directions

1. Combine all marinade ingredients in a large mixing bowl and whisk together. Remove half a cup of marinade and 
   reserve for basting the chicken later.

2. Place chicken in a large, resealable bag and pour marinade over the top. Cover chicken entirely and refrigerate 
   for at least 30 minutes (up to 24 hours). 

3. When done marinating, preheat the oven to 400°F. Place the chicken on a shallow baking sheet or pan and 
   cook for 18 to 22 minutes or until chicken reaches 165°F, basting while it cooks. Let chicken rest for 
   at least 5 minutes before serving. 

## Notes

- For optimal flavor, make sure the chicken is cut thinly, allow it to marinate for as long as
  possible, and baste it frequently while it cooks.
