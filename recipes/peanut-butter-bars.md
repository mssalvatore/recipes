# Peanut Butter Bars

## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Butter, melted | 1 cup |
| Natural peanut butter | 18 oz |
| Powdered sugar | 1 cup |
| Graham crackers, finely crushed | 3 packages (1 box) |
| Dark or semi-sweet chocolate chips | 20 oz |

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 200Â°F. 

2. Mix together all ingredients minus the chocolate chips. Flatten the mixture
   into a 9x13 pan and sprinkle the chocolate chips on top. 

3. Put in the oven until chips begin to look glossy, approximately 13 minutes.
   Remove from the oven and spread the chocolate gently over the bars, making
   sure not to pull up the peanut butter mixture. Once cooled, put in the
   fridge or freezer to harden. 


## Notes

- Peanut butter: Creamy or chunky can be used, depending on personal
  preference.
- Sweetness: The sweetness level can be adjusted to suit tastes (e.g., Using
  milk chocolate and/or adding more chocolate chips will make this sweeter.).
- Chocolate chip brand: Don't use off-brand chocolate chips, or they won't
  melt.
