# Baked "Ziti"

## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Mozzarella (shredded) | 475g |
| Pecorino Romano (grated) | 100g |
| Ricotta | 550g |
| Rigatoni/Ziti | 1 lb |
| Tomato Sauce | 4-5 cups |



## Directions

1. Boil the pasta in salted water until molto al dente.

2. Spread a thin layer of sauce on the bottom of a 13"x9" baking dish to keep
   the pasta from sticking.

3. Put a layer of pasta in the bottom of the dish. Layer the ricotta, pecorino
   romano, sauce and mozzarella on top. Repeat until the ingredients are used
   up or there's no more space in the pan. Finish with a layer of sauce to
   prevent cheese from sticking to the aluminum foil.

4. Cover with foil and bake at 375Â°F for 30-40 minutes or until the sides
   bubble.

5. Remove the foil and bake for another 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is
   golden brown.


## Notes
- The dish is called "baked ziti", but I prefer rigatoni.
- Don't use canned sauce! [Make your own](meat-sauce.md).
- Buy fresh mozzarella and shred it yourself. Don't use the stale, cellulosed,
  pre-shredded stuff.
