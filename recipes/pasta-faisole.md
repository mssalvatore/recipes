# Pasta Faisole

## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Bacon | 1 lb |
| Cannellini beans | 31 oz |
| Cannellini beans (for puree, optional) | 15.5 oz |
| Crushed tomatoes | 112 oz |
| Ditalini pasta (dry) | $\frac{1}{2}$ lb |
| Garlic | 8 cloves |
| Pepper | To taste |
| Oregano | To taste |
| Salt | To taste |


## Directions

1. Fry the bacon in a pan. When the bacon is done, remove the bacon from the
   pan and set the bacon fat aside.

2. Optionally, puree 15.5 ounces of cannellini beans and set aside.

3. Open the crushed tomatoes if they are canned.

4. Press the garlic into a small container. Pour enough bacon fat into a pot to
   fry the garlic. Once the bacon fat is hot (340Â°F), add the garlic and spread around
   with a spatula. Sprinkle some salt. Keep the garlic moving with the spatula.

5. Just as the garlic begins to brown, quickly pour in the crushed tomatoes and
   pureed cannellini beans.

6. Mix some salt, pepper, and oregano into the sauce.

7. Simmer for 1-2 hours to allow the flavors to blend. Taste and adjust the
   seasoning periodically.

8. Cook the ditalini in a separate pot of boiling water until molto al dente.
   Strain the pasta and add to the pot with the rest of the soup. Allow the
   soup to simmer until the pasta is al dente

## Notes

- Don't skimp on the oregano; it's the key to the flavor.
- You can leave out the ditalini and instead server it over rice. This is known
  as "impostor faisole".
