# Pasta Faisole

## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Bacon | 1 lb |
| Cannellini beans | 56.5 oz |
| Cannellini beans (for puree, optional) | 15.5 oz |
| Crushed tomatoes | 112 oz |
| Ditalini pasta (dry) | $\frac{1}{2}$ lb |
| Garlic | 8 cloves |
| Pecorino romano | To serve |
| Pepper | 5g |
| Oregano | 21g |
| Salt | 25g |


## Directions

1. Fry the bacon in a pan. When the bacon is done, remove the bacon from the
   pan and set the bacon fat aside.

2. Optionally, puree 15.5 ounces of cannellini beans and set aside.

3. Open the crushed tomatoes if they are canned.

4. Press the garlic into a small container. Pour enough bacon fat into a pot to
   fry the garlic. Once the bacon fat is hot (340Â°F), add the garlic and spread around
   with a spatula. Sprinkle some salt. Keep the garlic moving with the spatula.

5. Just as the garlic begins to brown, quickly pour in the crushed tomatoes and
   cannellini beans and stir.

6. Pour in the pureed cannellini beans.

7. Chop or break the bacon into pieces and add it to the pot.

8. Mix the salt, pepper, and oregano into the soup.

9. Simmer for 1-2 hours to allow the flavors to blend. Stir occasionally.

10. Cook the ditalini in a separate pot of boiling water until al dente.

11. Spoon the soup and pasta into bowls. Serve with Pecorino Romano.


## Notes

- Don't be afraid of the oregano; it's the key to the flavor.
- You can serve over rice instead of ditalini. This is known as "impostor
  faisole".
