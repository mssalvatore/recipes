## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Black pepper | To taste |
| Broccoli floret | 3.5 cups|
| Chicken breast (cubed) | 2.5 cups |
| Garlic | 9 cloves |
| Olive oil | As needed |

| Pecorino romano | 6 Tbsp |
| Red pepper (optional) | 2 Tbsp |
| Salt | To taste |


## Yield

Feeds 4 regular people or 2 Italians.


## Directions

1. Use a garlic press to press the garlic into a small
   container. Set aside.

2. Cut small florets off of a broccoli crown and set aside.

3. Cut chicken breast into cubes and set aside.

4. Boil the pasta in salted water until al dente. Drain and set aside.

5. While the pasta is boiling, heat olive oil in a 13" skillet. Use enough oil
   to cover the bottom of the pan.

6. Add the chicken to the pan with salt, black pepper, and oregano. Cook until
   the chicken is white on the outside.

7. Add the broccoli florets and cover. Cook until the broccoli reaches the
   desired tenderness.

8. Push the broccoli and chicken to the outside of the pan. Make a small pool
   of olive oil in the center. Once the oil is hot (360Â°F), add the pressed
   garlic and spread around with a spatula. Sprinkle some salt. Keep the garlic
   moving with the spatula.

9. Just as the garlic begins to brown, quickly mix the garlic, chicken, and
   broccoli together to prevent the garlic from burning.

10. Mix in the pasta. If it seems too dry, add a bit of olive oil. Add the
    pecorino romano and red pepper (optional) and stir together. Serve with
    additional pecorino romano on the side.


## Notes
- If you're trying to feed 4 people with this meal, make a side also. A
  [sourdough boule](sourdough-boule.md) is a good option.

- Go easy on the salt at each stage. The pecorino romano adds saltiness. You
  can always add more cheese or salt later on.

- This dish should be "oiled" but not "oily".
