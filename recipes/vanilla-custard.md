# Vanilla Custard

## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Heavy cream | 180 ml ($\frac{3}{4}$ cup) |
| Whole milk | 180 ml ($\frac{3}{4}$ cup) |
| Egg yolks | 4 large eggs |
| Cornstarch | 2 tsp |
| Sugar | 3 Tbsp |
| Vanilla extract | 1 tsp |

## Directions

1. Heat the cream and milk in a double boiler until bubbles just start to rise
   at the edge of the pan (don't boil it).

2. In a jug, mix the egg yolks, cornstarch, sugar, and vanilla extract.

3. When the cream is hot, pour into the egg mixture in a thin stream whilst
   stirring with a hand whisk (don't pour in the milk all at once or it will
   scramble the eggs). Once mixed together, pour back into the double boiler
   and continue to stir the custard with a whisk over medium heat until it
   thickens. If it gets too thick, add a splash of cream.

4. Turn off the heat and serve.
