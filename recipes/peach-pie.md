# Peach pie

## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| [9-inch pie crust](all-butter-pie-crust.md)| 2 crusts |
| Brown sugar | 1 cup (firmly packed)|
| Sliced, peeled peaches | 4 $\frac{1}{2}$ cups |
| Cornstarch | 3 tbsp|
| Ground nutmeg | $\frac{1}{4}$ tsp (or to taste) |
| Ground cinnamon | $\frac{1}{2}$ tsp (or to taste) |
| Salt | $\frac{1}{8}$ tsp |
| Lemon Juice | 2 tsp |
| Butter | 1 tbsp |
| Egg, lightly beaten (for an egg wash) | 1 egg |


## Directions
1. Prepare your pie crust so that the bottom crust is in the pan and in the
   refrigerator. The top crust can be resting in the refrigerator too, but
   don't roll it out quite yet.
2. In a large bowl, combine the sugar and the sliced peaches. Toss gently.
   Cover with plastic wrap and let stand for one hour.
3. After an hour, place the peaches in a strainer over a saucepan, so that the
   juices can drain into the pan. Give them a gentle stir to ensure you've
   gotten as much of the liquid out of the mixture as possible. Place the
   peaches back in the large bowl and set to the side for the moment.
4. In a separate small bowl, whisk together the cornstarch, nutmeg, cinnamon
   and salt. Add this mixture to the peach juice in the saucepan. Heat on
   medium-low on the stove top, stirring constantly to keep the mixture from
   scorching or caramelizing. Once the mixture comes to a boil, continue
   stirring constantly for one minute. It should start to become rather thick.
   Remove from the heat. Stir in the lemon juice and butter; the butter should
   melt very rapidly.
5. Pour the hot mixture on top of the peaches and gently mix, so that the
   peaches are evenly coated with the mixture. It will be quite thick. Remove
   the bottom crust from the refrigerator. Egg wash it, then spoon the filling
   into the crust.
6. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. While the oven preheats, roll out the
   remaining pastry. At this point, you can simply roll it into a circle and
   place it on top of the pie for a traditional double crust, adding several
   pricks with a fork to allow steam to vent.
7. Lightly brush the top crust with the egg wash.
8. Cover the edges loosely with foil.
9. Place the pie in the oven. Bake for 50-60 minutes or until crust is golden
   brown and filling is bubbly. Remove foil. Cool on a wire rack for several
   hours before serving.
