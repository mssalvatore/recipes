# Thanksgiving Turkey

## Ingredients

### Aromatics

| Ingredient | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Butter | Enough to cover bird |
| Cinnamon stick | 1 stick |
| Fresh rosemary | 4 sprigs |
| Fresh sage | 6 leaves |
| Red apple, quartered | 1 apple |
| Water | 1 cup |
| Yellow onion, quartered | $\frac{1}{2}$ onion |

### Brine

| Ingredient | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
|  Allspice berries | 1 $\frac{1}{2}$ tsp |
|  Black peppercorns | 1 Tbsp |
|  Chopped candied ginger | 1 $\frac{1}{2}$ tsp |
|  Kosher salt | 1 cup|
|  Light brown sugar | $\frac{1}{2}$ cup |
|  Turkey (whole) | 14-16lbs |
|  Vegetable broth | 1 gallon|

## Directions
1. Two to three days before roasting, begin thawing the turkey if frozen. To
   thaw safely, do so in the refrigerator or in a cooler kept at 38F.

2. You can also make the brine at this time: Combine the vegetable broth, salt,
   brown sugar, peppercorns, allspice, and candied ginger in a large stockpot.
   Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally to dissolve the
   sugar and salt. Once the mixture comes to a boil, remove from the heat,
   cover, and let cool to room temperature. Refrigerate at least until
   completely chilled, or until the turkey is completely thawed.

3. Early on the day of or late the night before you’d like to eat, brine the
   turkey. Combine the chilled brine and the ice water in a 5-gallon cooler.
   Place the turkey (giblets and other innards removed) in the brine, breast
   side-down. If necessary, weigh down the bird to ensure it is fully immersed,
   then set in a cool area for 8 to 16 hours, turning the bird halfway through
   brining.

4. When you’re ready to roast, heat the oven to 500F. Adjust the oven racks so
   that the turkey will fit on the lowest rack in the oven.

5. Remove the turkey from the brine, and rinse the inside and out with cold
   water. Discard the brine.

6. Place the bird on a flat roasting rack on a half-sheet pan or roasting pan
   and pat very dry with paper towels.

7. Pre-form an aluminum shield (aka turkey triangle) by folding a sheet of
   heavy duty aluminum foil to form a triangle. Grease lightly with butter,
   then place over the turkey breast so that the point is towards the legs.
   Press on the sides of the foil to form it to the breast and hold its shape.
   **Remove and set aside for now**.

8. Combine the apple, onion, water, and cinnamon stick in a microwave-safe dish
   and microwave on high for 5 minutes. Add the steeped aromatics (not the
   water) to the turkey’s cavity, along with the rosemary and sage. Tuck the
   wings underneath the bird and coat the skin lightly with butter.

9. Roast on the lowest level of the oven for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, open
   the oven and slide the rack out to access the turkey. Working quickly,
   insert a probe thermometer into the thickest part of the breast, avoiding
   any bones, and top with the turkey triangle. Slide the turkey back into the
   oven and reduce the oven temperature to 350F. Set an alarm on the probe to
   go off at 155F. A 14- to 16-pound turkey should take an additional 90
   minutes to 2 hours, but the temperature of the meat is more important than
   the time it takes to get there, so pay attention to the probe.

10. Let the turkey rest, still on the roasting pan and lightly coated with foil
    for at least 15 minutes longer before transferring to a cutting board and
    carving.

## Notes

- If you buy a turkey that has already been brined then skip the brine-related
  steps of the recipe.

- Coat the turkey with warm (still solid) butter on top of and underneath the
  skin. This helps seal in moisture to prevent the bird from drying out.
