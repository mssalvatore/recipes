   the dry ingredients. Mix well, just until combined. Don't overmix.

2. Grease a pancake griddle or cast-iron skillet with melted butter or oil.
   Heat the skillet over medium-low heat. Ladle $\frac{1}{3}$ cup batter on the hot
   griddle. Cook until it starts bubbling on top, then gently flip the pancake.
   Cook for an additional 1â€”2 minutes on the second side or until the pancake
   is cooked through and golden brown.

3. Serve warm with butter and maple syrup.

## Notes

- Feel free to include chocolate chips or fresh fruit in the batter.
