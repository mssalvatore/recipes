# Skirlie

## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Beef drippings/fat | 120g |
| Onions | 2 onions|
| Pepper | 3g |
| Salt | 8g |
| Steel-cut oats | 300g |
| Water | 630g |


## Directions

1. Melt the beef drippings in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions
   and cook until they're soft.

2. Add the steel-cut oats and pepper to the pan and stir well.

3. Add about $\frac{1}{3}$ of the water to the pan.

4. Cook until the oats reach the desired tenderness (about 20-25 minutes). Stir
   periodically. Add more water (about 210g at a time) if the oats are too tough.

5. Once the oats reach the desired tenderness, add the salt and stir well.


## Notes
- Traditionally, skirlie is made with beef drippings, but you could substitute
  another fat (such as butter) if beef drippings are not available.

- Scottish skirlie recipes do not typically include water, but the oats may be
  too tough without it. This may be because different oats are available in
  Scotland or perhaps American palates just prefer a softer texture.
