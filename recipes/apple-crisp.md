### Crumble Topping

| Ingredient | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Old-fashioned rolled oats | 1 $\frac{1}{3}$ cups (108g) |
| All-purpose flour | 1 cup |
| Light brown sugar | 1 cup |
| Cinnamon | 1 tsp |
| Baking powder | 1 tsp |
| Salted butter<br>(cut into small pieces) | 1 cup |

### Apples

| Ingredient | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Large Granny Smith apples | 3—4 apples |
| Salted butter, melted | 3 Tbsp |
| All-purpose flour | 2 Tbsp |
| Lemon juice | 1 Tbsp |
| Milk | 3 Tbsp |
| Vanilla extract | $\frac{1}{2}$ tsp |
| Light brown sugar | $\frac{1}{4}$ cup |
| Cinnamon | $\frac{1}{2}$ tsp |
| Nutmeg | $\frac{1}{4}$ tsp |

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 375°F. In a medium-sized bowl, combine oats, flour, brown
   sugar, cinnamon, and baking powder. Add butter and cut in with a pastry
   blender or fork until well combined. Refrigerate while you prepare the apple
   filling.

2. Peel and slice apples thinly and place in an 8x8 baking dish.

3. In a small bowl, stir together melted butter and flour until smooth. Add
   lemon juice, milk, and vanilla and stir. Stir in brown sugar, cinnamon, and
   nutmeg. Pour the butter mixture over the apples and toss to coat.

4. Sprinkle the crumble topping evenly over the apples. Bake for about 35
   minutes or until golden brown. Remove from the oven and cool at least 15
   minutes before serving. Serve with vanilla ice cream.

## Notes

- Substituting peaches for apples is a great variation.
