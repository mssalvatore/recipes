| Ingredient | Quantity |

## Directions

1. Lightly butter a 9x9 dish. Add the dates and water to a bowl. Leave to soak
   for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, use a fork to squish the dates (don't
   drain).

2. Preheat the oven to 170°C/325°F (fan). Beat together the butter and sugar
   until creamy, then mix in the eggs, one at a time. Stir in the vanilla
   extract and golden syrup.

3. Add half the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and half the milk.
   Stir gently to combine, then add in the remaining flour and milk. Stir again
   until just combined.

4. Add the mushed-up date mixture (including the liquid). Stir, then spoon into
   the prepared baking dish. Cook in the oven for 25—35 minutes until firm on
   top.

5. About 10 minutes before the cake is ready, make the toffee sauce. Place the
   sugar and butter in a medium saucepan with half the cream. Bring to the boil
   over a medium heat, stirring all the time, until the sugar has completely
   dissolved.

6. Stir in the golden syrup, then turn up the heat slightly and let the mixture
   bubble for 2—3 minutes until it turns to a light-brown toffee colour. Stir
   it occasionally to make sure it doesn't burn.

7. Take the pan off the heat and stir in the rest of the cream. Put to one
   side.

8. Take the sponge out of the oven and pour half of the toffee sauce over the
   sponge. Serve with the remaining toffee sauce and with [vanilla
   custard](./vanilla-custard.md).
