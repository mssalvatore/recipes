# Butternut Squash Soup

## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Butter | $\frac{1}{2}$ cup |
| Garlic | 1 clove |
| Small white onion | 1 onion |
| Butternut squash | 2 $\frac{1}{2}$ lbs (~ 1 lg squash) |
| Chicken broth | 1 32-oz box |
| Nutmeg | 1 tsp |
| Kosher salt | 1 tsp or to taste |
| White pepper | 1 tsp |
| Heavy cream | $\frac{1}{2}$ to 1 cup |
| Toasted seeds |

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F.

2. Peel and cut butternut squash into $\frac{1}{2}$-inch chunks. (Set aside
   seeds for later.) Dice onion. Mince garlic.

3. In a large soup pot, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the garlic,
   onion, and squash, and sauté until the onion is translucent and tender,
   about 10 minutes.

4. Add the broth, nutmeg, salt, and white pepper. Increase the heat to
   medium-high and bring to a rolling boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until
   the squash is very tender, about 25 minutes.

5. Stir in as much cream as desired.

6. Blend the soup in batches until it is smooth. Return to pot.

7. Rinse reserved squash seeds. Toss with a drizzle of oil and a pinch of salt
   and nutmeg. Spread evenly on a pan and roast for 10 minutes or until just
   starting to pop.

8. Serve soup with toasted seeds as garnish.

## Notes

- Add garlic to taste; we like to add several cloves.

- Substitute black pepper if you don't have white pepper.
