# Magic Cheesecake Bars

## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Graham crackers | 9 (one package) |
| Unsalted butter, room temp | 4 Tbsp |
| Granulated sugar | 1 $\frac{1}{2}$ tsp |
| Cream cheese, room temp | 2 (8 oz each) |
| Eggs | 2 eggs |
| Sweetened condensed milk | 1 can (14 oz) |
| Vanilla | 1 tsp |
| Salt | $\frac{1}{4}$ tsp |
| Semisweet chocolate chips | 1 cup |
| Shredded coconut | 1 cup |
| Crushed walnuts | $\frac{1}{3}$ cup |

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Line an 8" x 8" baking pan with parchment.

2. In a food processor, pulse graham crackers until finely ground. Add butter
   and sugar and pulse until mixture starts to come together and resembles wet
   sand. Pour mixture into prepared pan, pressing to ensure all sides and edges
   are even and firm.

3. In the large bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat
   cream cheese until soft and pliable. Add eggs one at a time, beating to
   blend after each addition. Scrape down sides of bowl. Add milk, vanilla, and
   salt and beat until combined and smooth.

4. Pour cream cheese mixture over crust. Sprinkle with chips, coconut, and
   walnuts.

5. Bake cheesecake until firm to the touch and coconut begins to turn golden
   brown, 35 to 40 minutes. Let cool to room temperature, about 1 hour.
   Refrigerate until cold, at least 2 hours or up to overnight.
