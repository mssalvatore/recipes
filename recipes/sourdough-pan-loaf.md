# Sourdough Pan Loaf

## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
|  Bread flour  | 1362g |
|  Salt  | 35g |
|  Sourdough starter (100% hydration)  | 300g |
|  Water  | 1004g |
|  Whole spelt flour  | 90g |
|  Whole rye flour  | 46g |

## Yield

2 loaves

## Directions
1. Mix the flour and water in a bowl until it comes together into a shaggy
   mass.

2. Let the dough sit overnight. If possible, fold it a few times to better
   hydrate all the flour.

3. Mix in the starter and salt.

4. Use slap-and-fold or any other kneading technique until the dough can pass
   the window pane test.

5. Allow the dough to ferment in a warm room until it increases approximately
   50% in size.

6. Divide the dough in two and pre-round the dough into an oval shape. Let sit
   for 20-40 minutes.

8. Shape the dough into a loaf and place it in a lightly oiled 12" x 4.5" x 3"
   pan. Cover the loaves with a damp towel or cloth to prevent a skin from
   forming. Allow the dough to proof until it fills the pan.

9. Preheat the oven  to 425F for 45 minutes prior to baking with a baking stone
   (or an overturned cast-iron skillet to server as a baking stone). Place a
   pan full of lava rocks on the bottom rack of the oven. This will be used to
   create steam during baking.

10. Remove the towel from the loaves 15-30 minutes prior to baking. Add water
    to the lava rocks to pre-steam the oven.

11. Score the loaves as desired and place on the baking stone. Add more water
    to the lava rocks if they're dry to create steam. Allow the loaves to bake
    in the steamy oven for 20 minutes.

12. After 20 minutes, remove the steam and reduce the temperature to 375F. Bake
    for another 20 minutes or until the edges start to catch or the crust
    reaches the desired color.

13. Remove the loaves from the oven and gently turn them out of the pans onto a
    cooling rack. Allow the loaves to cool before eating (at least two hours).
