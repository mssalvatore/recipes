# Red Pepper Marinara

## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Black pepper | 1g |
| Garlic | 28g |
| Fresh parsley | 50g |
| Olive oil | As needed |
| Red pepper| 3g |
| Whole, Peeled, plumb tomatoes | 6lb, 6oz |


## Directions

1. Add enough olive oil to fry the garlic in the bottom of a pot. Fry the
   garlic.

2. Just as the garlic begins to brown, add the tomatoes and stir the garlic in.

3. Add the red and black pepper.

4. Roughly chop the parsley and add it to the pot.

5. Use an immersion blender to blend the tomatoes until smooth.

6. Simmer until the flavors blend (about 1-2 hours).

## Notes
- Use whole tomatoes. It is rumored that crushed or pureed tomatoes are the
  ones that weren't good enough to leave whole.
