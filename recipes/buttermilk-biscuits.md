# Buttermilk Biscuits

## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| All-purpose flour | 2 cups |
| Baking powder | 4 tsp |
| Sugar | 3 tsp |
| Salt | $\frac{1}{2}$ tsp |
| Butter | $\frac{1}{2}$ cup |
| Egg | 1 egg |
| Buttermilk or sour milk | $\frac{2}{3}$ cup |

## Directions

1. In a bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt. Cut in butter
   until it resembles course crumbs. 

2. Beat egg in with the milk and stir into the dry ingredients, just until
   moistened. Turn on to a floured surface and knead approximately 20 times.
   Press or roll to $\frac{3}{4}$-inch thickness. 

3. Cut out biscuits. Place on a lightly greased baking pan. Bake for 8—10
   minutes at 450°F. Brush with butter. Serve warm.

## Notes
- Baking tip: When measuring flour, never scoop out the flour right into your
  measuring cup. Instead, take another cup and lightly fill your measuring cup
  with "loose" flour from a second cup versus using "packed" flour right from
  the container.
- If you don't have buttermilk, mix 1 Tbsp vinegar or lemon juice into 1 cup
  milk. Stir and let sit for 10 minutes before using.
