## Yield

6 tortillas


## Directions

### Soft tortillas

1. Mix maseca, salt, and water together in a bowl.

2. Knead by hand until the dough is smooth and comes away from the sides of the
   bowl.

3. Cover with a wet towel and let sit for 20 minutes after kneading.

4. Divide into pieces (about 50g each) and roll into balls.

5. Press into tortillas of desired thickness.

6. Cook on a comal/griddle (500°F) for about 1 minute per side or until fully
   cooked.

### Garnachas

To make garnachas:

7. Take the tortilla off the comal after approximately 1 minute per side. Shape
   into bowls while the tortillas are still hot by pinching around the edge of
   the tortilla to form a rim.

8. Use a fork to prick the top-side of the garnacha to prevent bubbles from
   forming during frying.

8. Heat enough canola oil to submerge the garnachas in a frying pan or deep
   fryer. Once the oil is hot (360°F), fry the garnachas in the oil until they
   are a golden color. Flip as necessary to achieve an even color.

9. Remove the garnachas from the oil and place on a plate with a paper towel.
   Place the plate in the oven at 180°F until all of the garnachas are fried
   and ready to be served.

10. Fill with a filling of your choice and serve with a sauce and/or garnish.
    See [Garnachas Molinas](./garnachas-molinas.md) and [Garnachas
    Negras](./garnachas-negras.md) for good filling options.


## Notes

- Use warm water when mixing the dough.
- Keep the uncooked dough balls or tortillas covered with a wet towel to keep
  dough from forming a skin.
- If making garnachas, leave the tortillas a bit thicker when pressing (step
  5).
