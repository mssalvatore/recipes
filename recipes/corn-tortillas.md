# Corn Tortillas

## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Quantity | Doubled | Quadrupled
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Maseca | 130g | 260g | 520g |
| Salt | 3g | 6g | 12g |
| Water | 200g | 400g | 800g |


## Yield

6 tortillas


## Directions

1. Mix maseca, salt, and water together in a bowl.

2. Knead by hand until the dough is smooth and comes away from the sides of the
   bowl.

3. Let sit for 20 minutes after kneading.

4. Divide into pieces (about 50g each) and roll into balls.

5. Press into tortillas.

6. Cook on a comal/griddle (500f) for about 1 minute per side or until fully
   cooked.


## Notes

- Use warm water.
- Cover with a wet towel to keep dough from forming a skin.
- If making garnachas, about 1min per side is probably enough. Form into bowls
  while tortilla is still hot.
- The comal/griddle should be approximately 500Â°F.
