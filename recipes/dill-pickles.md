# Dill Pickles

## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Pickling cucumbers | 10-12 cumbers |
| Water | 4 cups |
| White vinegar | 2 cups |
| Pickling salt | 2 tsp
| Dill | Lots! |
| Garlic | 2 heads | 
| Peppercorn kernels (optional) | To taste |

## Directions

1. Thoroughly wash cucumbers and slice into 1/4-inch thick slices or spears.

2. Peel garlic and slice thinly.

3. Separate dill from thick stems. 

4. Sanitize mason jars by boiling them for at least 5 minutes. Remove jars from
   boiling water with tongs and set aside to dry.

5. Combine water, vinegar, and salt. Bring the mixture to a boil and swirl the
   pan to ensure the salt dissolves. Remove the pan from heat.

6. Tightly pack the sliced cucumbers, dill, peppercorns, and sliced garlic into
   the jars. Fill the jar with enough brine to cover the cucumbers.

7. Seal jars with an airtight lid and allow them to cool to room temperature.
   Store in the refrigerator after jars are cool.

8. Allow jars to sit in the refrigerator for approximately two weeks.


## Notes

- Stuff as much fresh dill and cucumbers pears in the jars as you can fit.
- More garlic probably won't hurt anything.
- Pouring the brine in while it's hot seems to help shorten the wait time until
  the pickles are ready to eat.
