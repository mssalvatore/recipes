# Honey Garlic Chicken

## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Soy sauce | $\frac{1}{3}$ cup |
| Honey | $\frac{1}{3}$ cup |
| Garlic | 4 cloves |
| Lime or lemon juice | 2 Tbsp |
| Boneless chicken breasts or thighs | 2 lbs |
| Cornstarch | 1 Tbsp |

## Directions

1. Whisk together the soy sauce, honey, garlic, and lemon juice in a medium
   bowl until well combined.

2. Add the chicken to a slow cooker. Pour over about $\frac{3}{4}$ of the honey garlic
   sauce and toss to coat. Set the remaining honey garlic sauce aside while the 
   chicken cooks.

3. Cover and cook on high for 2—4 hours or low for 4—6, or until the chicken is 
   cooked through and very tender.

4. Remove the chicken to a cutting board and let it cool slightly, then shred
   it with two forks.

5. To thicken the sauce, remove 2 Tbsp of the cooking liquid to a medium bowl.
   Whisk in the cornstarch, then add back to the slow cooker, along with the
   remaining honey garlic sauce, whisking to combine.

6. Cover and cook the sauce by itself on high for 15—30 minutes or until it
   thickens.

7. Add back the chicken, stir to combine, and allow it to warm back up. Serve
   with rice.


## Notes

- Add garlic to taste; we usually use more than 4 cloves.

- Worcestershire sauce be be substituted for soy sauce, making the marinade a
  little sweeter.
