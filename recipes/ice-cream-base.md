# Ice Cream Base

## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Egg yolks (large) | 6 |
| Granulated sugar | 175g ($\frac{2}{3}$ cup) |
| Heavy cream | 482g (2 cups) |
| Salt | $\frac{1}{8}$ tsp |
| Vanilla extract (optional) | 2 tsp |
| Whole milk | 250g (1 cup) |


## Directions

1. In a small pot, simmer heavy cream, milk, sugar and salt until sugar
   completely dissolves, about 5 minutes. Remove pot from heat.

2. In a separate bowl, whisk yolks. Whisking constantly, slowly whisk about a
   third of the hot cream into the yolks, then whisk the yolk mixture back into
   the pot with the cream.

3. Return pot to medium-low heat and gently cook until mixture is thick enough
   to coat the back of a spoon (about 170 degrees on an instant-read
   thermometer).

4. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl.

5. Optionally add vanilla extract.

6. Chill in refrigerator overnight (1C).

7. Pre-chill a bowl in the freezer (as cold as possible, ideally -30C).

8. Churn in an ice cream machine.
