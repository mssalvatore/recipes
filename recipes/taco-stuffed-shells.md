# Taco Stuffed Shells

## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Cheddar cheese (shredded) | 3 cups |
| Ground beef | 2 lbs |
| Jumbo pasta shells | 38 shells |
| Salsa | 950g |
| Scallions | 4 stalks |
| Sour cream (served on the side)| 2 cups |
| [Taco seasoning](./taco-seasoning.md) | 6 Tbsp |
| Water | 1 $\frac{1}{4}$ cup |


## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350Â°F.

2. Cook the shells in salted water according to the package instructions. Stir
   often to keep the shells from sticking to the bottom. Drain the shells when
   molto al dente and set them aside to cool.

3. Heat a small amount of oil in a pan. Brown the ground beef. Use a spatula to
   break the ground beef into small pieces. Drain.

4. Mix the water and taco seasoning into a thin sauce.

5. Mix the seasoning sauce into the beef until the beef is thoroughly coated.
   Simmer until the excess moisture has evaporated.

6. Coat the bottom and sides of a baking dish with a thin layer of marinara to
   keep the shells from sticking to the dish.

7. Spoon the ground beef into the shells and place them in the baking dish. Do
   not overfill the shells!

8. Sprinkle the cheese over top of the shells. Spoon the salsa on top of the
   cheese and shells.

9. Cover with foil and place in the oven to bake for 20-30 minutes.

10. Remove from the oven and uncover. Spread the scallions over top and serve
    with sour cream.


## Notes

- There are approximately 47 jumbo shells in a 12 oz box (Barilla brand).
- Make extra shells. They are sometimes prone to breaking when you fill them.
- Don't forget to save the beef fat when you drain the beef. It's great for
  making [skirlie](./skirlie.md).
