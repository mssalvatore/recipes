# Sourdough Pitas

## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Quantity | Doubled |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bread/All-purpose flour | 500g | 1000g |
| Olive Oil | 15g | 30g |
| Salt | 9g | 18g |
| Sourdough starter (100% hydration)  | 20g | 40g |
| Water | 280g | 560g |


## Yield

8 pitas


## Directions

1. Mix all of the ingredients together in a free standing mixer for 4-5 minutes
   (or 8-10 minutes by hand).

2. Place the dough in a greased bowl and cover. Leave to rest for up to 24
   hours at a cool room temperature (18-20°C / 64-68°F).

3. Put a baking stone or cast iron skillet into the oven and preheat the oven
   as hot as it goes. 250°C/480°F will work but 300°C/570°F is ideal. Allow the
   oven to sit at the maximum temperature for 20 minutes to ensure the baking
   stone or cast iron skillet comes up to temperature.

3. While the oven is preheating, divide the dough into 8 equal ports (slightly
   over 100g each) and shape into balls. Cover and leave to relax for 10
   minutes.

4. Gently shape a ball of dough into a disk shape by hand. Then use a rolling
   pin to roll the disk into an even circle around 2-3mm thick.

5. Put the rolled-out disk into the oven onto the hot stone or cast iron. Be
   swift to prevent the oven temperature from dropping excessively. Bake for
   approximately 3-4 minutes, or until pitas reach the desired color.


## Notes
- 24 hours seems to be the right amount of time.

- This is much easier with two people. One person shapes pitas while the other
  keeps a close eye on the ones baking in the oven.

- If you want to make a quick yeast version of this recipe use 290 grams of
  water and 7 grams of instant yeast for the dough. Leave to proof for 1 hour,
  divide and make balls and leave to relax for 10 minutes. You can follow the
  recipe from there.
