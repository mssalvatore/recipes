# Crème Pâtissière

## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Butter (unsalted) | 42 g |
| Cornstarch | 40g |
| Egg yolk | 4 egg yolks |
| Milk | 494g |
| Kosher salt | 1 pinch |
| Sugar | 75g |
| Vanilla extract | 1 Tbsp |


## Yield

About 2 $\frac {1}{2}$ cups


## Directions


1. Mix the eggs, cornstarch, salt, and sugar together in a separate bowl. Whisk
   until all of the ingredients are evenly combined and the mixture turns a
   little pale in color. Ensure there are no lumps of cornstarch.

2. Immediately after step 1, combine the milk and vanilla in a pot. Heat the
   mixture until it's almost boiling. When it starts to steam or simmer, remove
   it from the heat. Mix the milk frequently during this process to prevent the
   milk from sticking to the bottom and burning.

3. Temper the egg yolk mixture by slowly pouring in some of the hot milk and
   whisking like crazy. Use about $\frac{1}{3}$ of the hot milk.

4. Pour the tempered egg mixture back into the sauce pan with the remaining
   milk. Whisk like crazy and return the pot to the stove.

5. Slowly heat the mixture to a boil while whisking like crazy. Keep the
   mixture constantly moving, otherwise the custard will turn into scrambled
   eggs.

6. The mixture will thicken just before coming to a boil. Once the pastry cream
   comes to a boil (sounds like bubbling lava), cook on low-medium heat for 1
   minute.

7. Take the pot off the heat and immediately add the butter. Whisk until the
   butter has melted and mixed evenly with the rest of the mixture.

8. Immediately strain the pastry cream into a cold container using a fine-mesh
   sieve.

9. Spread the custard evenly inside the bowl or container and immediately cover
   with plastic wrap. Make sure the plastic wrap is in contact with the entire
   surface of the pastry cream to prevent a skin from forming as the pastry
   cream cools down. Using a large/shallow pan will help the cream to cool down
   more quickly.

10. Allow the pastry cream to set in the fridge.

11. Once the pastry cream is cool and set, scrape it into a bowl and whisk the
    custard to make a smooth pastry cream.

## Notes
- An extra egg yolk will give the cream a richer flavor.

- Using half-and-half will give the cream a richer flavor than just milk.

- Increasing or reducing the cornstarch will affect how stiff the cream is.
  Using 60g of cornstarch leads to an extremely stiff cream. Pick an amount
  anywhere in the range of 30g-60g that yields a cream with the desired
  consistency.

- When tempering the eggs, wrap a damp town around the base of the eggs'
  container to keep it from sliding around as you whisk.

- Don't combine the sugar and eggs too far in advance of tempering them. The
  sugar can "cook" the egg yolks prematurely.
