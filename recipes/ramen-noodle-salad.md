### Salad

| Ingredient | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Butter | 2 Tbsp |
| Ramen noodles | 3 oz package |
| Sesame seeds | 3 Tbsp |
| Cabbage and/or spinach | 1 $\frac{1}{2}$ lbs |

## Directions

1. To make the dressing, combine the oil, vinegar, sugar, and soy sauce in a
   jar and shake until the sugar has dissolved.

2. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. While the butter is
   melting, crush the ramen noodles inside the package. (Remove the seasoning
   packet.) Add the noodles, almonds, and sesame seeds to the melted butter in
   the skillet. Saute while stirring frequently, until the noodle mixture is
   golden brown. Remove to a plate and let cool.

3. Shred the cabbage and slice the onions. Combine in a large mixing bowl. Add
   the noodle mixture. Pour the dressing over the salad and toss well to
   combine.
