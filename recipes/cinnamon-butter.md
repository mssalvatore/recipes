| Ingredient | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Butter, salted | 113g (1 stick) |
| Cinnamon | 5g | <!-- 4g -->
| Honey | 50g | <!-- 40g -->
| Vanilla extract | 1 tsp | <!-- $\frac{1}{2}$ tsp -->


## Yield

$\frac{1}{2}$ cup of cinnamon butter


## Directions

1. Soften the butter by leaving it on the counter for 1-2 hours.

2. Combine the ingredients in a mixing bowl. Mix using a whisk or electric
   mixer until the ingredients are evenly combined and the butter reaches the
   desired fluffiness.


## Notes
- Make the butter the day before you plan to eat it. It tastes better once the
  flavors have had time to blend.
