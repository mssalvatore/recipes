# Swiss Meringue Buttercream (DRAFT)

## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Egg whites | 7 large eggs |
| Granulated sugar| 495g |
| Creamy peanut butter (optional) | $\frac{1}{2}$ cup |
| Unsalted butter (softened) | 425g |
| Vanilla extract | 1 $\frac{1}{2}$ Tbsp |


## Directions
1. Start by placing the egg whites and sugar in a large metal bowl. I used the
   bowl that came with my KitchenAid mixer. Whisk the egg whites and sugar
   together. Place over a pot of boiling water while beating the mixture like
   crazy. Do NOT stop beating. You don't want scrambled eggs. Continue beating
   for 1.5 minutes. Remove from heat and immediately beat with an electric
   mixer (using a whisk attachment) on medium for a few minutes so it can
   thicken slightly, then turn up to high for 20 minutes. (I like to cover the
   mixer with a dish towel to prevent splatters.) Turn mixer down to low and
   gradually add butter. Turn mixer up to medium and beat for a few minutes.
   Turn mixer down and add vanilla. Mix again. Now add the peanut butter. Beat
   on medium for a few minutes. If the mixture is soupy, place in refrigerator
   for a couple of hours. Then take out, let it rest for a bit (it will be hard
   at first) and beat again on medium high to high for a few mintues or until
   it's light and fluffy.

2. Next, fill and frost your 3-layer cake with a crumb coat (thin layer of
   buttercream) and refrigerate for an hour before applying your "second coat"
   of frosting.

3. Frost chilled cake with another layer of frosting and smooth it with a bench
   scraper while the cake is on a turn table. See my video (above) for more
   details on frosting. Put the cake back in the fridge and let it chill for
   two hours. (Note: You will also need to put the remaining frosting back into
   the fridge as well. Then beat it again when you take it out after the two
   hours.) Make your chocolate ganache by placing chocolate chips in a
   microwave safe bowl. Heat on high for one minute. Stir. Heat for 20 seconds
   more. Stir in olive oil until smooth. Pour into a plastic squeeze bottle or
   a ziptop plastic bag with the corner cut. Drizzle chocolate on the edges
   then squeeze onto top of cake and smooth with a spatula.

4. Pipe the top and sides using a pastry bag fitted with a 1M tip from Wilton.
   Add Reeses peanut butter cups and chopped peanuts. Serve immediately or
   store in refrigerator until ready to serve. Store covered in the
   refrigerator for up to 5 days.


## Notes
- Swiss meringue is the only meringue that is safe for immunocompromised
  people, but only if the egg whites have been properly pasteurized (reached
  140Â°F).
