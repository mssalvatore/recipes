# Chicken Crescent Wreath

## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Crescent rolls | 2 tubes (8 oz each) |
| Colby-Jack cheese, shredded | 1 cup |
| Cream of mushroom soup | 1 can (10.5 oz) |
| Chicken | $\frac{3}{4}$ cup |
| Broccoli | $\frac{1}{2}$ cup |
| Red pepper | 1 pepper |
| Water chestnuts | 1 can (5 oz) |
| Onion | 2 Tbsp |
| Salt | to taste |
| Pepper | to taste |

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 375°F. While oven preheats, chop and cook chicken. Season
   with salt and pepper.

2. Chop all vegetables.

3. Arrange the crescent rolls on a 12-inch pizza pan, forming a ring, with
   pointed ends facing the outer edge of the pan and wide ends overlapping. 

4. Combine remaining ingredients (including more salt and pepper), and spoon
   the mixture over the wide ends of the rolls. Fold points over the filling,
   and tuck the wide ends under. (Filling will be visible.) 

5. Bake for 20—25 minutes or until golden brown. Serve over rice.

## Notes

- We like to double the water chestnuts to 2 cans.
- If feeling fancy, substitute crescent rolls with 16 oz or more of homemade
  puffed pastry. Bake for 7 minutes at 425°F and then lower to 400°F and bake
  until golden brown (~20 minutes).
