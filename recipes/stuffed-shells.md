## Yield

20 stuffed shells


## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 375°F.

2. Cook the shells in salted water according to the package instructions. Stir
   often to keep the shells from sticking to the bottom. Drain the shells when
   al dente and set them aside to cool.

3. Beat the eggs until smooth.

4. In a large bowl, mix the ricotta, beaten eggs, pecorino romano, parsley, and
   pepper (optional).

5. Coat the bottom and sides of a baking dish with a thin layer of marinara to
   keep the shells from sticking to the dish.

6. Fill the shells with the filling and place them in the baking dish. Do not
   overfill the shells!

7. Cover the shells with the remaining marinara and sprinkle the mozzarella on
   top.

8. Cover with foil and bake for 30 minutes at 375°F. Optionally, remove the
   cover and broil for 2-4 minutes to lightly brown the mozzarella cheese.

## Notes
- There are approximately 47 jumbo shells in a 12 oz box (Barilla brand).
- Make extra shells. They are sometimes prone to breaking when you fill them.
- To add some spice, mix 1 Tbsp of red or black pepper into the filling.
