## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Unsalted butter, room temp | 1 cup |
| Brown sugar | 2 cups |
| Eggs | 2 large eggs |
| Ripe bananas, mashed | 6—8 medium bananas |
| Vanilla | 2 tsp |
| All-purpose flour | 4 cups |
| Baking powder | 2 tsp |
| Baking soda | 1 tsp |
| Salt | $\frac{1}{2}$ tsp |
| Dark chocolate chips | 2 cups |
| Walnuts, chopped (optional) | 1 cup |

## Yield

2 loaves

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease and line a 9×5 loaf pan with parchment
   paper, making sure the parchment is hanging over the sides.

2. In a large bowl, cream butter and brown sugar together for about 2 minutes,
   until smooth. Stir the bananas into the batter. 

3. Whisk in the egg and add in the vanilla. Mix, scraping down the sides of the
   bowl, until well combined.

4. Add the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Make sure the flour is
   not clumpy. Mix until just combined.

5. Fold in the chocolate chips and optional walnuts. 

6. Pour the batter into the loaf pan and sprinkle a handful of chocolate chips
   on top. Bake for 55-65 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center
   comes out clean. Let the banana bread cool for at least 30 minutes before
   serving.

## Notes

- If using frozen bananas, make sure they have thawed (and/or been pre-mashed)
  before adding to the mixer.
