## Directions

1. Line a baking tray with baking parchment. Roll out half of the pastry on a
   lightly floured work surface until it is about 25x25cm/10x10in in size and
   slightly thinner than a pound coin.

2. Cut a 23cm/9in circle from the pastry by cutting around the bottom of a
   23cm/9in cake tin using a sharp knife. Transfer the pastry circle to the
   prepared baking tray and cover with cling film.

3. Repeat the process with the other half of the pastry, placing the second
   pastry circle on top of the cling film and covering with more cling film.
   Chill until needed.

4. For the filling, beat the softened butter until creamy using a wooden spoon
   or freestanding mixer. Add the sugar and beat again thoroughly until the
   mixture is pale and fluffy.

5. In a small bowl, beat the egg with the egg yolk until just combined.
   Gradually add it to the creamed butter and sugar mixture, a tablespoon at a
   time, beating well after each addition to incorporate the egg into the
   mixture.

6. When the mixture is very light in colour and texture, gently stir in the
   ground almonds, flaked almonds and almond extract. Cover the bowl with cling
   film and chill in the fridge for 15-20 minutes.

7. When the pastry and filling have cooled, remove the cling film from the
   pastry and leave one pastry circle on the baking tray. Spoon the filling
   mixture onto the pastry circle on the baking tray, heaping it into a slight
   mound in the middle and leaving a 2cm/1in border all around the edge. Brush
   the pastry border with some of the beaten egg, then gently lay the second
   pastry circle over the filling, pressing the edges firmly together to seal.

8. Holding a small knife blade at right angles to the pastry border, 'knock up'
   the edge of the galette by making small indentations all around the edge of
   the pastry. Scallop the pastry border by pushing the indentations in at
   2cm/1in intervals using the back of the knife. Brush the top of the galette
   all over with more of the beaten egg, then chill the galette in the fridge
   for 30 minutes.

9. Preheat the oven to 220¬∞C/200¬∞C Fan/Gas 7.

10. Brush all over the top of the chilled galette again with the remaining
    beaten egg, then score it with a criss-cross pattern using the tip of a
    sharp knife. Make a couple of small steam holes in the centre of the
    galette. Bake in the oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the pastry is crisp
    and golden-brown. Set aside to cool slightly before serving.
