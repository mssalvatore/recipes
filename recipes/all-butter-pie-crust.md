# All-Butter Pie Crust

## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| King Arthur unbleached all-purpose flour | 600g |
| Table salt | 2 tsp |
| Unsalted butter, cold | 454g |
| Ice water | 114g to 226g |


## Yield

4 pie crusts (top and bottom for 2 pies)


## Directions

1. Whisk together the flour and salt.

2. Dice the butter into small cubes, or cut it into pats. Work it into the
   flour until it's well-distributed, but not fully incorporated. Larger,
   pea-sized pieces of butter will be scattered throughout the mixture.

3. Tossing with a fork or your fingers, drizzle in the ice water. Stop adding
   water when the dough starts to come together, and grab it in your hands. If
   it holds together easily, without crumbling, it's ready. If it has dry spots
   or pieces break off easily, add a bit more water until it's totally
   cohesive.

4. Gather the dough into a ball, and divide it in half. Gently pat/shape each
   half into a rough disk. Roll immediately, if desired. For better texture,
   chill the dough for at least 30 minutes before rolling. If dough has been
   refrigerated longer than 30 minutes, allow it to warm at room temperature
   for 10 to 15 minutes, until it rolls easily.

5. Use as directed in your favorite pie recipe.


## Notes

- If you use salted butter, reduce the salt in the recipe to $\frac{1}{2}$ tsp.
- If you're not planning on using all of the crust, the excess can be stored in
  the freezer.
